# Salary Classification Based on Company, Position, and Experience

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project aims to **classify salary levels** using multiple features

The workflow includes:
1. Data preprocessing and feature extraction
2. Data visualization
3. Model training and evaluation

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```
1 extract_feature.ipynb   # Extract and preprocess features from raw data
2 visualization.ipynb     # Visualize and analyze the dataset
3 cluster.ipynb           # Salary classification and clustering experiments
company_fields.json       # Input dataset (contact author to obtain)
```

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3.12
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Make sure you have the file `company_fields.json` (contact the author to obtain it).
2. Run the notebooks in the following order:
   - `1 extract_feature.ipynb` â†’ Preprocess data & extract features
   - `2 visualization.ipynb` â†’ Generate visualizations and statistical analysis
   - `3 cluster.ipynb` â†’ Train and evaluate salary classification models

## ðŸ“Š Output
- **File 2 (`visualization.ipynb`)**: Generates visualizations showing data distribution and feature relationships.
- **File 3 (`cluster.ipynb`)**: Produces classification results, accuracy metrics, and clustering outputs.
